If the scrollbar still won’t appear after removing overflow: hidden; or setting overflow-y: auto;, it usually means one of these is happening:
	1.	No Actual Overflow
	•	If the content is not taller than the container, the browser won’t show a scrollbar.
	•	Temporarily add a bunch of extra lines or set a large min-height on the content to force overflow.
	2.	The Container Has No Fixed Height
	•	If .editor-wrapper (or its parent) is expanding to fit the content, there’s no overflow.
	•	Make sure the container or a parent element has a fixed or constrained height (e.g., height: 600px; or max-height: 80vh;) so content that exceeds this height can scroll.
	3.	Custom Scrollbars Are Hidden
	•	Some CSS might hide scrollbars globally, such as:

::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;
}


	•	Or you might have an OS-level setting (on macOS, for instance) that only shows scrollbars while actively scrolling.
	•	Test by explicitly forcing a scrollbar:

.editor-wrapper {
  overflow-y: scroll !important;
}


	4.	Parent Container Interference
	•	Check that no parent element is still using overflow: hidden; or has display: flex; without min-height: 0; (a common flexbox gotcha).
	•	Try temporarily adding an outline or border to see if the .editor-wrapper is actually the size you expect:

.editor-wrapper {
  outline: 2px dashed red;
}


	5.	JavaScript Resizing Logic
	•	Your calculateContentHeight() might be setting the minHeight of the <textarea> larger than the container, effectively removing any need for a scrollbar.
	•	Try removing or lowering the minHeight logic to confirm whether it’s preventing scrolling.

Quick Debug Checklist
	1.	Force a Scrollbar

.editor-wrapper {
  overflow-y: scroll !important;
  height: 400px; /* or some fixed size to prove overflow works */
}

Then add extra text to confirm the scrollbar appears.

	2.	Check the OS Settings
	•	On macOS, go to System Settings → Appearance → Show scroll bars and select Always.
	•	This ensures the scrollbar is visible even if you’re not scrolling.
	3.	Inspect in DevTools
	•	Hover over .editor-wrapper in your browser’s DevTools to see its computed height.
	•	If the element’s height is “auto” and the parent is not limiting it, there won’t be an overflow.

Once you verify the container has a fixed height and content that exceeds that height, the scrollbar will appear (assuming it’s not hidden by a custom CSS rule or OS-level setting).
